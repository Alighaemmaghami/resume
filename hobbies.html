    <h1>Ali Ghaemmaghami's Hobbies</h1>

    <h2>Movies</h2>
    <p>These are some of the movies I really enjoyed:</p>
    <h3>Inception</h3>
    <p>I really liked its idea and the puzzle that Mr. Nolan was created.</p>
    <h3>The Shawshank Redemption</h3>
    <p>The concept of hope and how it can affect people was astonishing.</p>
    <h3>Prestige</h3>
    <p>The drama around a puzzle was beautifully created in the movie.</p>

    <h2>TV Series</h2>
    <p>These are some of the TV series I really liked:</p>
    <h3>Breaking Bad</h3>
    <p>It is really difficult to see a TV series that you think you live with it. Most of the people have think of the first character as a hero who could have been them in real life.</p>
    <h3>The Sopranos</h3>
    <p>The ups and downs of characters in this series let you live like gangsters for some time! It was a good drama to watch and learn regarding real life.</p>
    <h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
    <p>It is really fascinating to see a world that is created from scratch by fiction and goes with all the details about each character and stories behind them.</p>

    <h2>Social Games</h2>
    <p>I enjoy playing social games such as the Mafia or gameboard games such as Risk, Secret Hitler, and Monopoly.</p>
    <h2>Gym</h2>
    <p>I really like working out. It gives me energy every time I feel the pain of a heavy dumbbell or barbell.</p>
