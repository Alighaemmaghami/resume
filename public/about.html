    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Ali Ghaemmaghami. I am a dedicated student currently pursuing research under the supervision of Dr. Andrea Schiffauerova and Dr. Ashkan Ebadi. My primary focus is on developing a decision support system aimed at early detection of emerging technologies. To achieve this objective, I employ various techniques and algorithms including Natural Language Processing, Text Mining, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning.</p>

    <p>During my tenure as a research assistant in the data science team at the National Research Council Canada, I had the privilege of working for approximately four months as my first job in Canada for the federal government. This experience provided me with invaluable exposure to a professional team and real-world problem-solving. It served as my second opportunity to contribute as a researcher and data scientist, allowing me to thrive in an advanced environment.</p>

    <p>My enthusiasm for the realm of data is boundless, as I am fascinated by the exploration of patterns and trends within vast datasets that are accessible to us all. I am open to embracing any opportunity that can enhance my experience of this dynamic field including an internship or a full-time job as I am graduating in 6 months.</p>
